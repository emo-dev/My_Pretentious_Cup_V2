# My_Pretentious_Cup_V2
NSS Backend Capstone Project. Re-doing Frontend With Python/Django

This project is somewhat of a Round 2. For my Frontend capstone at NSS I created an application called My Pretentious Cup.
For this project, I wanted to implement everything I learned in the backend of my course for the same project.
I've already created the before.. This is the after.
